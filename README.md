# Server-Client-WinSock
Text bot on the server (Alice): Exchange of text messages between the client and server parts of the application. The client reports his nickname at the entrance and sends text questions. The server responds with random messages from a set of standard response strings (at least 20 pieces). Messages are exchanged until the client sends a "Shut_Up" message.
